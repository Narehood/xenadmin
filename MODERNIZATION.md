# Modernization notes (development branch only)

XCP-ng Center is modernized **only on the `development` branch**.

## Supported workflow

- Integrate and release from `development`.
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/test-builds.yml`) restores packages, builds Release and Debug, runs unit tests, and uploads artifacts.
- Package versions are managed centrally in `Directory.Packages.props`.

## Runtime targeting

| Project | TFMs |
|---------|------|
| CommandLib, XenCenterLib, XenOvfApi, XenModel | `net481;net8.0` |
| XenAdmin (WinForms app) | `net8.0-windows` |

Update downloads and Import Wizard URL fetch use `HttpClient` via `HttpFileDownloader`.

### Plugins (opt-in, IE WebBrowser)

Plugin tabs (`TabPageFeature` / `WebBrowser2`) remain available but **disabled by default**. Enable with registry `EnablePlugins=1`. Credential look-ups no longer use `Application.DoEvents`; IE hosting is retained until a future UI rewrite replaces this surface.

### Planned later

- Full UI rewrite (current WinForms UI is Windows 7–era); not part of the present maintenance tranche, but intended.
- Broader async cleanup / installer CI automation.
- Linux client experiments are not part of this track (see non-goals).

## Non-goals

These tracks are **out of scope** for the current maintenance modernization unless separately funded and restarted from current `development`:

| Track | Status |
|-------|--------|
| `origin/avalonia` | Placeholder only. Do not revive as-is. |
| `master-linux*`, `linux-dev-cocoon` | Abandoned 2019 Mono experiments. Discard. |
| Re-sync from archived Citrix `xenserver/xenadmin` | Historical only. |

## TLS / certificates (XCP-ng self-signed)

XCP-ng ships with **self-signed** management certificates by default. The client must not require a public CA, and must not blindly accept every cert.

Policy implemented in `XenAdmin/Network/SSL.cs`:

- **Trust on first use (TOFU):** first connection to a host pins the certificate hash (optionally after a warning).
- **Later connections:** require the pinned hash; changes prompt (or follow Security options).
- **No accept-all:** low-level HTTP paths without the app TOFU callback reject untrusted chains instead of returning `true`.

## Public IP connection warning

When Add Server targets a literal public IP, `PublicIpWarningDialog` warns about exposing the management plane and suggests a VPN/SSH tunnel/private path. Users can proceed or cancel; “don’t show again” and Options → Security control `WarnPublicIpConnection`. Non-IP hostnames are not warned (no DNS resolve in this pass).

## Stale local scripts

`branding-xcp-ng/build.sh` and parts of `brand-to-xcp-ng.sh` describe an obsolete .NET 4.6 / VS2013 / packages-folder flow. The supported build path is SDK-style MSBuild / `dotnet` via GitHub Actions and the [Building wiki](https://github.com/xcp-ng/xenadmin/wiki/Building).
